# PearUP

## What is PearUP?

PearUP is a web app I built to make job searching easier with your friends or classmates. Instead of scrolling through LinkedIn, you can see what jobs your friends are applying for and go for the same ones if you want. It’s a way to share opportunities and support each other.

There’s also an admin page for teachers (or whoever is the admin) to check:
- How many total job applications have been posted.
- How many unique companies people have applied to.

## Features

### For Regular Users
- **Post Jobs**: Add the jobs you're applying for so your friends can see them.
- **Browse Jobs**: Check out what jobs others are applying for.

### For Admins
- **Admin Dashboard**: See the total number of applications and how many are unique (different companies).

## What’s Missing/Needs Work
1. **CSS Tweaks**:
   - The app looks decent, but it’s not perfect. For example, the spacing at the top needs fixing.

2. **Admin Login**:
   - Admin login info has to be added directly to the database. There’s no way to create an admin account through the app yet.

3. **Security**:
   - Passwords aren’t encrypted, which means the login isn’t very secure right now.

## What I Used to Build It
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, EJS
- **Database**: MariaDB
- **Icons**: [Boxicons](https://boxicons.com) (for making it look cooler)
- **Other Tools**: Nodemon (for restarting the server while coding)
